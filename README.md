Price fluctuations have always created an environment that is unfavourable to the correct expectations of economic agents. They make the producers and consumers who depend on the products affected by their effect vulnerable. Yet one of the ways to reduce vulnerability and poverty in rural areas is to ensure stable prices. The current work contributes to the ongoing discussion on the determinants of food price volatility in Benin, in this case the price of maize. Based on theoretical considerations, economic, agricultural, and political causes of the price volatility of internal maize are identified and discussed.
We have exploited the advantages of the ARCH and MIDAS with Almon lag weighting models (2002). The results of the study suggest some volatility in the prices of maize in the markets and this volatility is determined in the markets studied, by rainfall, the price of gasoline, the prices of substitute goods, the prices of maize in the markets national or regional demand, and regional production. As far as public policies are concerned, those from 2008 to 2016 seem to have had the expected effects. In addition, the study recommends stabilizing prices through improved functionality of the internal and external markets. The development of road infrastructures, the increase in smallholder productivity and social protection are factors not to be neglected in stabilizing maize prices.

This paper analyses the impact of electricity consumption on production on the one hand and the determinants of aggregate electricity demand on the other hand. The results show that it is economic growth and the value added of services that cause electricity consumption in the Granger sense. The consumption of electricity itself leads to industrial added value, which proves that there is an energy-dependent economic dynamic in the industrial sector. Moreover, this study shows that the rate of urbanization and the share of industry in GDP are determinants of the aggregate demand for electricity in Benin.

Key words: Electricity demand, Economic growth of Benin, Granger causality test.
